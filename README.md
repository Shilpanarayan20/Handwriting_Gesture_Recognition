# Handwriting Gesture Recognition

1) Implementation of segmenting writing activity from random gestures or activities performed in air using finger worn sensor.
2) Implementation of prediction of characters and numbers.

sample examples for both tasks:

* Not Writing and Writing activity segmentation:
* Characters and numbers segmentation:

# Project files description

Consist of three folders :

1) Dataset which consist of prepared data for all three data representation for both tasks, and data preprocessing file.
2) Models - 5 different segmentations networks .py files : Bi-LSTM , LSTM , ResNet , OS-CNN , GTN 
3) Best Models - Saved models of Best performed network for each data representation and for each category of classes (Writing).
